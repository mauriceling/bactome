    Calculates the number of generations and generation time using
    turbidity measurement of cell culture (usually OD600 readings)
    between 2 time points (min1 and min2).
    
    Parameters:
        A2 = turbidity measurement at min2.
        A1 = turbidity measurement at min1.
        conv = conversion ratio between OD readings to cell count.
            Default is 0.3 OD = 5e7 (50 million) cells, standard for
            Escherichia coli.
        limit = OD reading at which limit of proportionality of the
            conversion ratio no longer holds, such as cell size decrease
            or increase with higher OD readings.
            Default is 0.301, for Escherichia coli.
        gradient and intercept = the gradient and intercept for cell
            number correction when OD is above limit of proportionality.
            Correction equation:
                cell count = gradient * ln(OD) + intercept
            Default value of gradient is 52137400 and intercept is
            118718650.
