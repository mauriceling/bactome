Loose Circular Brainfuck (LCBF) Interpreter
Date created: 15th August 2012
Licence: Python Software Foundation License version 2

LCBF uses all 8 operations in standard Brainfuck with the 
following differences:
1. The tape or array is circular (a ring list) instead of 
linear. When the pointer is at the "end" of the tape, an 
increment (">") will move the tape to the start. Similarly, 
when the pointer is decremented at the "beginning" of the 
tape, the pointer goes to the end.
2. Operations after a start loop operator ("[") will only be 
executed provided the loop(s) are properly closed. If the 
loops are open, the program will terminate.
3. However, it is possible to have an end loop operator ("]") 
without a preceding start loop operator ("["). In this case, 
the end loop operator ("]") will be ignored and execution continues.
4. Unclosed or unopened loops may result in non-deterministic 
behaviour.
5. All inputs are pre-defined at the start of the program.
