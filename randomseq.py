    Function to generate a mixed sequence, which can take many forms. 
    For example, this function can be used to generate a random 
    sequence of 30-40 nucleotides, followed by a 10-nucleotide 
    constant region, followed by a random region of exactly 20 
    nucleotides. 

    Usage:

        python randomseq.py MS --n=10 --start_codons="TTG,CTG,ATG" --stop_codons="TAA,TAG,TGA" --cap_start=True --cap_stop=True --selection="A,250;T,250;G,250;C,250" --fasta=True --prefix="Test" --statement="v(10,15,False,False,False,False);o(start);c(gtccg);v(20,30,False,False,False,False);o(stop)""

    The statement is a specification describing the random sequence to 
    generate. Each part of the sequence is specified in the format of 
    v(<min length>, <max length>, <allow start>, <allow stop>, <cap 
    start>, <cap stop>) or c(<constant sequence>). A random sequence 
    of 25-35 nucleotides, not allowing either start or stop codons 
    with the sequence but required capping the 5"-end of the sequence 
    with start codon is defined as v(25,35,False,False,True,False). A 
    constant region, 5"-GAATTC-3", is defined as c(GAATTC). Start 
    codon is defined as o(start) and stop codon is defined as o(stop). 
    Each part is then concatenated with semi-colon. Hence, the 
    definition, v(10,15,False,False,False,False);o(start);
    c(gtccg);v(10,15,False,False,False,False);o(stop), will generate a 
    sequence of (1) a random region of 10 nucleotides, followed by (2) 
    another randomly selected start codon, followed by (3) a constant 
    region of gtccg, followed by (4) a random 20-30 nucleotide 
    sequence, followed by (5) another randomly selected stop codon. 
    The resulting sequence will be 10 to 15 (first variable region) + 
    3 (start codon) + 5 (constant region) + 20 to 30 (second variable 
    region) + 3 (stop codon) = 41 to 56 nucleotides long.

    @param n Integer: Number of random sequence(s) to generate.
    @param selection String: Definition of the atomic sequence(s), 
    defined as a semi-colon delimited definition of comma-delimited 
    definition, used for random sequence generation. Default = 
    "A,250;T,250;G,250;C,250" which means that the list of atomic 
    sequences is defined as 250 "A", 250 "T", 250 "G", and 250 "C".
    @param start_codons String: A comma-delimited list to represent 
    start codons. This is used for two purposes. Firstly, it can be 
    used to check the randomly generated sequence to ensure that there 
    is no start codons within the sequence. Secondly, it can be used 
    to cap the start of a newly generated sequence.Default = 
    "TTG,CTG,ATG".
    @param cap_start Boolean: Flag to determine whether to cap the 
    start of the randomly generated sequence with a start codon. 
    Default = False.
    @param stop_codons String: A comma-delimited list to represent 
    stop codons. This is used for two purposes. Firstly, it can be 
    used to check the randomly generated sequence to ensure that there 
    is no stop codons within the sequence. Secondly, it can be used 
    to cap the stop of a newly generated sequence.Default = 
    "TAA,TAG,TGA".
    @param cap_stop Boolean: Flag to determine whether to cap the 
    end of the randomly generated sequence with a stop codon. 
    Default = False.
    @param source_seq String: A sequence to be used to generate the 
    atomic sequence(s), used for random sequence generation. The 
    atomic sequence(s) is/are essentially an single-character 
    alphanumeric of the sequence, where relative abundance of each 
    character is determined by the occurrence in the sequence.
    @param fasta Boolean: Flag to determine whether the output is to 
    be formatted as a FASTA file. Default = True.
    @param prefix String: Prefix to the running number for the 
    sequence name, if the output is to be a FASTA format. Default = 
    "Test".
    @param statement String: Specification statement of the random 
    sequence to generate. Please see above description. Default = 
    "v(10,15,False,False,False,False);c(gtccg); 
    v(10,15,False,False,False,False)"
